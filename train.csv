13	13	70668_13276	o6	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. <br/> If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. <br/> Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.	we did not create the baby, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.

271	271	30319_54474	o5	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women.

318	318	arg33126_arg33054	o6	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
319	319	arg33105_arg33128	o7	it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.	"Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are ""advancing the common good"", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money."
321	321	arg33058_arg33054	o6	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
324	324	arg33054_arg33142	o6	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.

329	329	arg33073_arg33125	o7	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
331	331	arg33073_arg33173	o6	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.

Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
333	333	arg33073_arg33086	o7	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.

If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.

336	336	arg33146_arg33145	o7	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
337	337	arg33054_arg33053	o6	In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a break down or something.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
341	341	arg33158_arg33118	o7	I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
343	343	arg33102_arg33088	o6	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.
345	345	arg33127_arg33121	o5	I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.	Our animal insctinc is survival, its what makes us flinch wen we see something coming at ous it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.
346	346	arg33123_arg33101	o6	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.	"Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a ""winner"". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit."
347	347	arg33128_arg33144	o7	I thing personal pursuit because i believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself. Helping yourself first would make you a better person and i think that after you achieve your goals and becoming a better person you would be able to help the common good.	"Well for me its a kind of a 50/50.

350	350	arg33115_arg33088	o6	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others.

355	355	arg33073_arg33165	o7	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
359	359	arg33111_arg33115	o7	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.
365	365	arg33118_arg33091	o6	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.
368	368	arg33054_arg33146	o6	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
377	377	arg33150_arg33069	o7	Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.	I think that personal pursuit is better because i think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back you even if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.
381	381	arg33149_arg33058	o7	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.	"At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is ""I"" who I must help first."

I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are ""advancing the common good"", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money."
389	389	arg33157_arg33128	o7	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.	"Well for me its a kind of a 50/50.

Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
395	395	arg33158_arg33126	o7	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made.

397	397	arg33167_arg33111	o7	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve.

399	399	arg33057_arg33054	o6	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
404	404	arg33053_arg33111	o7	In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a break down or something.	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve.

408	408	arg33086_arg33111	o5	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out.

414	414	arg33125_arg33121	o7	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.	Our animal insctinc is survival, its what makes us flinch wen we see something coming at ous it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.
416	416	arg33173_arg33157	o5	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference.

471	471	arg33105_arg33121	o6	it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.

472	472	arg33058_arg33073	o7	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
474	474	arg33165_arg33101	o5	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.	"Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a ""winner"". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit."
475	475	arg33158_arg33173	o7	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made.

If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.
483	483	arg33128_arg33159	o7	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.	"Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are ""advancing the common good"", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money."
484	484	arg33073_arg33115	o7	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.

485	485	arg33091_arg33142	o6	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.

Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve.

People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind.

1156	1156	1635_28498	o5	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. <br/> And I know many children get adopted but many don't <br/> and it might be better off to just have an abortion to <br/> let them suffer. <br/> That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to <br/> decide one womans pregnancy.	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.
1157	1157	37929_1639	o5	Im going to take the Obama approach to this <br/> Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it	"It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of ""who decides""? <br/> A woman is not your property. Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude."
1166	1166	1633_43517	o6	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh? <br/> Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
1167	1167	74766_1660	o7	The right to abortion should not be abused, <br/> however I do believe that the choice should be provided. <br/> NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.	So then you're saying the if the woman were to get an abortion right after than t would be fine?
1175	1175	1634_73708	o7	It really depends the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
1179	1179	1654_37093	o5	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.	"Ahora en mi querido idioma, lo diré <br/> Eso a lo que llaman un ""bebé, un ser humano"" no es más que una planta, menos, me atrevería a decir <br/> Lo único que hace es chupar recursos, al igual que la planta, aunque las plantas nos dan oxígeno... <br/> Nadie niega que sea una vida, pero no puede sentir ni pensar, que es lo que suelen decir que hace más a los humanos que a los animales <br/> El aborto es matar a un parásito"

1182	1182	1683_1661	o7	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
1183	1183	1674_28415	o6	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? <br/> If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
1185	1185	1635_63512	o7	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.

1207	1207	1641_1700	o7	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.

America grants citizenship to people ""born"" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. <br/> Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?"
1454	1454	arg334943_arg334927	o6	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals lol I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
1455	1455	arg335086_arg335095	o6	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
1458	1458	arg334934_arg335096	o6	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem.

1460	1460	arg335032_arg336204	o6	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. <br/> Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.

Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them	Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.

They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
1657	1657	arg335129_arg335096	o6	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.	I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option
1659	1659	arg334891_arg335032	o7	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. <br/> Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
1660	1660	arg335129_arg334961	o6	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.	I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option
1662	1662	arg334927_arg336209	o7	No because if we hit our children their gonna think that we don't love them.	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals lol I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
1664	1664	arg334890_arg335114	o6	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.	There's some parents that spank their children for every little thing. And that is not right. They will always be scared of them.
1669	1669	arg335086_arg335132	o7	I disagree on the parents use spaking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
1670	1670	arg334968_arg334943	o6	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.
1672	1672	arg335032_arg335091	o6	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.	Spanking should never be the answer.

1678	1678	arg335086_arg334958	o7	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
1679	1679	arg335132_arg334929	o5	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.

1690	1690	arg336894_arg335091	o6	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
1691	1691	arg334926_arg336179	o6	No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child.
1692	1692	arg335096_arg335030	o7	Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
1694	1694	arg335564_arg335132	o7	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them	I disagree on the parents use spaking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens

1700	1700	arg335032_arg335104	o6	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done like if some one else made thm mad thy let it all out on thm	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. <br/> Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
1703	1703	arg335086_arg335084	o7	I think parents should not spank because there's other way to make them behave.	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
1706	1706	arg334890_arg335104	o5	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.

1709	1709	arg336048_arg336029	o7	People should not hit there kids because the kid will think it is OK to hit someone else back like for an example at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.	does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody then you get hit. you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the saame person

We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children . It is not make sense.

2246	2246	arg251944_arg345997	o7	I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving!

2249	2249	arg7751_arg251944	o6	It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life.

2252	2252	arg552867_arg244438	o6	Yes, because... <br/> 1st, It's a fun activity of the school day, that we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our excerse-- lose the weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but... <br/> 2nd, Obesity is certainly a proble in the U.S., so it would help! <br/> 3rd, People can have a moment that they'll eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat!...................................... <br/> I'm Done!!...

2256	2256	arg107456_arg71112	o6	Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.	Definattley all those obese kids need excersise and its a whloe part of life of course it should be mandortory.
2263	2263	arg107450_arg251946	o5	In my opinion I think that it should be obligatory to have PE classes in schools because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes would be obligatory there would be much less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.

2269	2269	arg54258_arg110326	o7	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.	if physical educations r not ter then u wud b a couch potato <br/> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!howzz tat???
2271	2271	arg96685_arg135251	o7	I agree with everything said her because children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.	You are 100% right because I am in Pe and they make us wear these stupid outfits. I think they make us wear those so the Gay coaches can see our private parts. and PE is just Stupid
2274	2274	arg7765_arg251944	o7	Yes of course. Apart from the health benefits, there's the greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation to name but a few.

2429	2429	arg345997_arg406468	o7	I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!	"people are just sitting on there asses all day playing video games when they need there fucking exercise.

2814	2814	arg168793_arg168764	o6	Farquhar was the one that played the role of a 'mother' to Singapore.He contributed more to Singapore than Raffles supporting the fact that he was the founder of Singapore.	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper, but Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.
2817	2817	arg168783_arg168823	o6	Farquhar won the affection and respect from the people with his doings. When he was sacked, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.	Farquhar ordered his men to go to Malacca and bring some food back. The traders in Singapore also brought some of the necessities here.
2823	2823	arg168774_arg168777	o5	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
2824	2824	arg168768_arg168777	o5	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar so i believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
2831	2831	arg167722_arg168786	o7	When Farquar was fired by Raffles, he was given a grander ceremony before he left compared to Raffles, which show how much the people loved him.	Farquhar did all the ground work to improve Singapore but Raffles only dreamt about what to do.
2839	2839	arg168830_arg168776	o7	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.	Raffles came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
2843	2843	arg168793_arg168791	o6	There were pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests hurt some people. The rats also destroyed the food supplies. Tigers were also a threat to the people here. He solved it by giving rewards were given to those people who killed these pests.	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper, but Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.
2846	2846	arg168767_arg168780	o6	Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
2847	2847	arg168779_arg168825	o7	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles	Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.

We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.

To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
4300	4300	arg335124_arg334886	o5	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.
4305	4305	arg334884_arg336176	o6	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
4306	4306	arg334921_arg335134	o6	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works
4307	4307	arg335089_arg334964	o7	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again
4309	4309	arg336563_arg335285	o6	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
4311	4311	arg335097_arg335285	o5	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
4313	4313	arg335047_arg334922	o6	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
4314	4314	arg335097_arg336199	o7	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
4315	4315	arg336043_arg334932	o7	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
4316	4316	arg334938_arg335285	o6	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort

4321	4321	arg336176_arg334924	o7	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
4322	4322	arg335134_arg335054	o7	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest.

4468	4468	arg335285_arg335098	o6	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
4470	4470	arg335047_arg334920	o6	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
4476	4476	arg335134_arg336176	o7	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works
4477	4477	arg334921_arg335092	o6	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
4479	4479	arg334967_arg334886	o7	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
4481	4481	arg334898_arg335124	o6	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
4484	4484	arg334924_arg335285	o6	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort

4491	4491	arg336199_arg334923	o6	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
4500	4500	arg336171_arg334884	o6	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
4503	4503	arg334964_arg336199	o6	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
4507	4507	arg334959_arg336043	o6	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad
4509	4509	arg335092_arg335285	o5	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
4510	4510	arg334973_arg334893	o6	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.
4513	4513	arg335094_arg336199	o5	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
4516	4516	arg334923_arg335034	o5	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.

4521	4521	arg334922_arg334972	o5	I believe some parents should spank their kids but only when nessasary because sometimes thats the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
4524	4524	arg334921_arg336199	o7	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.

I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
4529	4529	arg336199_arg335089	o6	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.

4534	4534	arg334932_arg334919	o7	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.	spanking can be sometimes good for the child to understand but not to the point where you can hurt and should not be used repeatedly

4538	4538	arg334938_arg336176	o7	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.

4571	4571	arg33272_arg33254	o7	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.	"I put my argument on the side saying ""yes"" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?"
4572	4572	arg33370_arg33345	o7	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
4576	4576	arg33230_arg33348	o5	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	I say yes i would because no matter what nothing should make you kill any one, How are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake.thats not right I dont care what nobody say if it was a mistake or what.
4577	4577	arg33366_arg33312	o6	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me, who knows? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.
4578	4578	arg33312_arg33272	o5	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone.

4586	4586	arg33261_arg33349	o7	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.
4588	4588	arg33323_arg33253	o6	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. <br/> So yea, i would turn them in.	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marrie sombody that would muder anyone. But that's beside the point.
4589	4589	arg33370_arg33367	o7	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would turn my spouse in.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
4591	4591	arg33318_arg33323	o7	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. <br/> So yea, i would turn them in.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
4593	4593	arg33344_arg33339	o6	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.	If my husband murder someone I will turn him in , because is a crime and for every act, I have learn that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
4595	4595	arg33293_arg33307	o7	I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
4598	4598	arg33303_arg33284	o7	In this situation it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always commited with the best of intentions to kill. It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. <br/> My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.
4599	4599	arg33318_arg33261	o7	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried.

After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
4602	4602	arg33271_arg33372	o7	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.	I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
4606	4606	arg33293_arg33280	o7	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.

4611	4611	arg33221_arg33304	o6	I would say that most likely I would turn my husband in because a murderer is not who I wanted to marry. And also, if my husband killed someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder and thats not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.	The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.
4613	4613	arg33323_arg33269	o6	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. <br/> So yea, i would turn them in.	It all depends on the severity of the kill. Ofcourse I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense, or to defend his family or belongings I would probably leave and want nothong to do with it.
4614	4614	arg33221_arg33261	o7	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried.

Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
4630	4630	arg33230_arg33245	o5	I would definetly turned her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.	I say yes i would because no matter what nothing should make you kill any one, How are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake.thats not right I dont care what nobody say if it was a mistake or what.
4631	4631	arg33311_arg33318	o7	I would definately turned them in even if it hurst me. Any person that commits a murder should not get away with it because if they did it once they can do it again so it dangerous to have them out in the enviroment. Also, if i dont turn her in how do i know that later on in life i might be a victim.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
4634	4634	arg33372_arg33349	o6	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.	I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
4635	4635	arg33284_arg33261	o6	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	In this situation it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.

4672	4672	arg33304_arg33367	o6	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger.

Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.

After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught.

4707	4707	arg33293_arg33366	o7	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person.

Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.	Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy.

I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in.

Ofcourse I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense, or to defend his family or belongings I would probably leave and want nothong to do with it.
4793	4793	arg33318_arg33348	o6	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
4794	4794	arg33345_arg33254	o7	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.	"I put my argument on the side saying ""yes"" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?"
4797	4797	arg33339_arg33254	o6	"I put my argument on the side saying ""yes"" but in reality it really depends in my opinion.

I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?"	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.
4798	4798	arg33289_arg33366	o6	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.
4799	4799	arg33289_arg33349	o6	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.
4806	4806	arg33323_arg33366	o6	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. <br/> So yea, i would turn them in.
4808	4808	arg33345_arg33332	o6	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.	"I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain ""How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?"" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's."
4812	4812	arg33289_arg33293	o7	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
4814	4814	arg33338_arg33342	o7	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accompalice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I wil call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me	I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
4815	4815	arg33224_arg33307	o7	I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
4818	4818	arg33338_arg33332	o7	"I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain ""How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend?

You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
4820	4820	arg33303_arg33282	o5	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always commited with the best of intentions to kill. It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. <br/> My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
4829	4829	arg33271_arg33253	o7	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marrie sombody that would muder anyone. But that's beside the point.

Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me, who knows? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.

Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.

5446	5446	12573_57300	o6	now tell me this evolution beleivers... how is it that evolution is true, and man kind is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you whom HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in arabic makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of adam...	* <br/> If evolution is true.... <br/> How come people aren't still evolving?

There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.

5451	5451	12581_12592	o5	I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger

They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.

No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.	I say lousy, if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. <br/> However, if pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc...

I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
6486	6486	arg35759_arg35750	o5	Children have two role models; mom and dad.

Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
6487	6487	arg35609_arg35650	o7	I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
6490	6490	arg35688_arg35720	o6	Having a Lousy father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a Lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
6492	6492	arg35751_arg35759	o6	Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.	It is better to have a lousy father because; when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector. <br/> Almost every father is lousy, because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father thinking that they had a father, in any shape or form.
6493	6493	arg35720_arg35714	o7	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.

It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
6495	6495	arg35585_arg35609	o7	I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
6496	6496	arg35609_arg35615	o7	Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy they are still our kin.	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
6500	6500	arg35647_arg35619	o7	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. <br/> So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way) <br/> Also, people change. Who says that he will be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.	I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I'm doing just fine. <br/> I just think thats it better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him, or what he looks like would ( to me ) be a insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to know he exist would be better to me.
6501	6501	arg35693_arg35720	o6	I Believe that its better to have a lously father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a lously father would mean you cant prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
6504	6504	arg35655_arg35635	o7	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.
6505	6505	arg35640_arg35650	o7	I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.	I think is better to have a lousy father than a fatherless because you can count on your father. No matter what your father is always going to be there for you in the good and bad times. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father than you don't have nobody to count with or tell him your problems.
6506	6506	arg35751_arg35732	o7	I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.	It is better to have a lousy father because; when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector. <br/> Almost every father is lousy, because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father thinking that they had a father, in any shape or form.
6516	6516	arg35750_arg35697	o7	I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.	I say lousy, if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. <br/> However, if pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
6517	6517	arg35609_arg35716	o7	To have a father is better than to not have one at all. I know that a lousy father is very bad to have and he probaly wont do all the things that a good father would do, but at least yo have that assurance that you have someone that is a father in your life. I beileve that people can change. You can never feel the same way about somebody for your whole life. There will come a time in his life that he will realize that he needs to be there for you. You have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
6518	6518	arg35759_arg35584	o5	It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.	Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.
6521	6521	arg35636_arg35629	o6	I think it's better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because, growing up without a father can be hard for some kids. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong, but as long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have somebody their to support your decisions and encourage you.	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
6522	6522	arg35638_arg35643	o7	A lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.	I rather have a lousy father then not have a father at all. Having a lousy father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if he's lousy you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
6523	6523	arg35693_arg35726	o6	It would be better to have a lousy father than to not a have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.	I Believe that its better to have a lously father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a lously father would mean you cant prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.

To be fatherless, there's not even a chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father would be better.
6529	6529	arg35746_arg35751	o6	To my knowledge people are able to change and make themselves better people. I would much rather have the hope that my father could be a good father, than know that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could of been.	It is better to have a lousy father because; when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector. <br/> Almost every father is lousy, because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father thinking that they had a father, in any shape or form.
6531	6531	arg35720_arg35585	o5	I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that.

No matter what your father is always going to be there for you in the good and bad times. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father than you don't have nobody to count with or tell him your problems.	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.

It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better.

A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.

6562	6562	arg35609_arg35714	o7	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.

I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
6630	6630	arg35666_arg35650	o7	I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.	I would have to pick having a lousy father than not having a father at all because, there will be a point where you may need his help. (It may not help but at least you tried.) I know that I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
6632	6632	arg35609_arg35642	o7	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesnt think I need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
6635	6635	arg35647_arg35720	o5	I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I'm doing just fine. <br/> I just think thats it better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him, or what he looks like would ( to me ) be a insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to know he exist would be better to me.	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
6636	6636	arg35584_arg35629	o6	It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
6641	6641	arg35655_arg35698	o6	"Its better to have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, ""I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better"". Even if you have a lousy father his going to love you no matter what."	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.

Who says that he will be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.	I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
6645	6645	arg35585_arg35714	o7	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.	I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
6647	6647	arg35720_arg35635	o7	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
6653	6653	arg35697_arg35700	o6	I would have to choose a lousy father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for you or the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps thing stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty lousy but he does support me and helps out sometimes I would rather have a father than none.	I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.

If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is.

I say lousy, if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. <br/> However, if pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc...

I rather have a lousy father then not have a father at all. Having a lousy father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if he's lousy you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is.

Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father.

Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings.

All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. <br/> Not once did i say that we are still evolving. <br/> I have not made any such assertions. <br/> So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. <br/> So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. <br/> And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. <br/> It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
6738	6738	80854_809	o7	"Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. <br/> The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space.

You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism <br/> --- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)

Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen. <br/> Who says that God did it himself? <br/> Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur? <br/> FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION

How were you brought up? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night? <br/> I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). <br/> So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.

People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away."	all i have to say on this issue is that there is actual evidence to support evolution!!

7012	7012	58082_794	o7	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution	I like to think both are true. <br/> 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) <br/> 2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) <br/> I believe in God and Evolution.
7013	7013	780_813	o5	think about it, it's impossible for evolution to NOT happen. the weak die, the strong continue to breed. this strengthens the species. argument over. <br/> however, creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. i don't believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing	"What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? <br/> Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself ""I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus."" <br/> Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time."

Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
7019	7019	58082_80854	o7	"Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. <br/> The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the ""Goldilocks"" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans."	I like to think both are true. <br/> 1.

7242	7242	419_405	o7	I find that whatever works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). <br/> Just some reason why i prefer Firefox.

7246	7246	397_413	o6	Internet Explorer sucks extreme memory when running multiple tabs, and more than Firefox. And probably more; it could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances and use those as a blind.	Firefox has nothing to do with apple or Steve Jobs. I'd say you're the fanatical zealot fanboy.
7247	7247	397_389	o6	Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards while  soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards to keep their monopoly.	Firefox has nothing to do with apple or Steve Jobs. I'd say you're the fanatical zealot fanboy.
7250	7250	477_468	o6	From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. <br/> There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. <br/> And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. <br/> Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?

8122	8122	arg33060_arg33139	o7	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
8126	8126	arg33139_arg33147	o7	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ.

8127	8127	arg33156_arg33090	o5	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.
8133	8133	arg33147_arg33133	o7	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.
8135	8135	arg33061_arg33131	o6	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
8137	8137	arg33129_arg33100	o7	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
8141	8141	arg33089_arg33129	o5	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
8142	8142	arg33114_arg33136	o7	"I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, ""Your not the most important person in the world"". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first."	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
8144	8144	arg33134_arg33177	o7	"Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a ""better place"", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten ""us"" into some not so happy predicaments."	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
8146	8146	arg33049_arg33114	o7	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

So we need each other and depend on each other to be great."	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community.

8149	8149	arg33061_arg33176	o7	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
8151	8151	arg33122_arg33103	o7	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
8152	8152	arg33135_arg33114	o5	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
8154	8154	arg33090_arg33084	o6	"Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, ""it feels good to help out."" <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself."	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.
8155	8155	arg33113_arg33100	o7	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
8158	8158	arg33155_arg33178	o7	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	"Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says ""Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor."" For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no ""I in Team"", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.

8159	8159	arg33061_arg33075	o7	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
8161	8161	arg33156_arg33139	o5	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
8167	8167	arg33061_arg33090	o7	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people.

8168	8168	arg33160_arg33162	o7	"This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear ""it's human nature to be selfish"" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space."	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.

8227	8227	arg33129_arg33049	o6	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.

Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.
8308	8308	arg33177_arg33099	o6	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
8309	8309	arg33131_arg33100	o7	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
8310	8310	arg33060_arg33089	o7	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
8311	8311	arg33176_arg33156	o7	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.

It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
8316	8316	arg33084_arg33061	o7	"Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, ""it feels good to help out."" <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself."	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.

If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.

I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.

A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
8400	8400	arg35670_arg35673	o6	In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
8402	8402	arg35718_arg35604	o6	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.

8404	8404	arg35679_arg35604	o7	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
8405	8405	arg35670_arg35622	o6	I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
8406	8406	arg35748_arg35652	o6	Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.	I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.

To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.

I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.

A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.

Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.

In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason.

It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.	I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.

During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous.

8620	8620	arg35669_arg35606	o7	I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.

In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason.

It just means that the kid will want to be lousy like his dad. Besides, you can't miss what you never had.
8633	8633	arg35606_arg35604	o7	I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.

I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in.

I wouldn't want my husband to be in jail.	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
8865	8865	arg33358_arg33341	o5	If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again.

8866	8866	arg33279_arg33328	o7	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did.

8869	8869	arg33353_arg33262	o6	Of course not! Absolutely not! Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would done. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!	No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
8870	8870	arg33255_arg33358	o5	Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong.

8875	8875	arg33300_arg33252	o5	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know? ;)

People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most.

If my husband committed murder I wouldn't turn them in because I know he must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took.

But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.	I dont think i could turn my spouse in, or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them.

9090	9090	arg33328_arg33354	o7	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
9100	9100	arg33353_arg33233	o6	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.

I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust.

I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
9108	9108	arg33279_arg33226	o6	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.	I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did then I couldn't do that to her.
